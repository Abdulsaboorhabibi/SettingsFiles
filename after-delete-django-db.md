The error "no such table: mande_project" indicates that Django is unable to find the table for the `Project` model in your database. This can happen for several reasons. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. **Check database migrations**: Ensure that you have applied all database migrations for your Django project. Run the following command to apply pending migrations:

    ```
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

   This command will create database tables based on your models. If there are any new migrations, Django will apply them to your database.

2. **Verify database connection**: Confirm that your Django project is connected to the correct database. Check your `settings.py` file to ensure that the database settings (such as `ENGINE`, `NAME`, `USER`, `PASSWORD`, `HOST`, `PORT`) are correctly configured to connect to your database.

3. **Check for model changes**: If you have made any changes to your `Project` model, make sure to create and apply migrations using the following commands:

    ```
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

4. **Database synchronization**: If you suspect that the database schema is out of sync with your models, you can try running the following command to synchronize the database schema with your models:

    ```
    python manage.py migrate --run-syncdb
    ```

5. **Inspect database**: If the issue persists, you can inspect your database directly to see if the `mande_project` table exists. Use appropriate tools (such as a database client or command-line interface) to connect to your database and check for the presence of the `mande_project` table.

6. **Debugging**: Enable Django's debugging mode (`DEBUG = True` in `settings.py`) to get more detailed error messages. This might provide additional clues about the cause of the issue.

By following these steps and investigating the potential causes, you should be able to identify and resolve the "no such table" error in your Django project.
