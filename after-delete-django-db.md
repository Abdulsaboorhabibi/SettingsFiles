Resetting migrations in Django involves several steps to ensure that your database schema and migrations are synchronized properly. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to reset migrations:

1. **Backup your data**: Before resetting migrations, it's crucial to back up your database to prevent data loss. You can use database backup tools or export your data to a file.

2. **Delete existing migrations**: Delete all migration files in your Django app's `migrations` directory except for the `__init__.py` file. You can manually delete these files or use the following command:

    ```
    rm -rf <app_name>/migrations/*.py
    ```

3. **Reset database schema**: Drop your existing database tables or create a new database. You can do this using your database management tool or by running Django's `migrate` command with the `--fake-initial` option:

    ```
    python manage.py migrate --fake-initial
    ```

   This command marks all migrations as applied without actually running them.

4. **Recreate migrations**: Recreate initial migrations for your Django app by running the following command:

    ```
    python manage.py makemigrations <app_name>
    ```

   Replace `<app_name>` with the name of your Django app.

5. **Apply migrations**: Apply the newly created migrations to your database:

    ```
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

   This will create tables based on your models and apply the migrations.

6. **Repopulate data**: If you backed up your data in step 1, you'll need to repopulate your database with the backed-up data.

7. **Test**: Finally, thoroughly test your Django application to ensure that everything is working as expected with the reset migrations.

It's important to note that resetting migrations should be done with caution, especially in production environments, as it can result in data loss or unexpected behavior. Make sure to back up your data and thoroughly test your application after resetting migrations.

The error "no such table: mande_project" indicates that Django is unable to find the table for the `Project` model in your database. This can happen for several reasons. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. **Check database migrations**: Ensure that you have applied all database migrations for your Django project. Run the following command to apply pending migrations:

    ```
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

   This command will create database tables based on your models. If there are any new migrations, Django will apply them to your database.

2. **Verify database connection**: Confirm that your Django project is connected to the correct database. Check your `settings.py` file to ensure that the database settings (such as `ENGINE`, `NAME`, `USER`, `PASSWORD`, `HOST`, `PORT`) are correctly configured to connect to your database.

3. **Check for model changes**: If you have made any changes to your `Project` model, make sure to create and apply migrations using the following commands:

    ```
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

4. **Database synchronization**: If you suspect that the database schema is out of sync with your models, you can try running the following command to synchronize the database schema with your models:

    ```
    python manage.py migrate --run-syncdb
    ```

5. **Inspect database**: If the issue persists, you can inspect your database directly to see if the `mande_project` table exists. Use appropriate tools (such as a database client or command-line interface) to connect to your database and check for the presence of the `mande_project` table.

6. **Debugging**: Enable Django's debugging mode (`DEBUG = True` in `settings.py`) to get more detailed error messages. This might provide additional clues about the cause of the issue.

By following these steps and investigating the potential causes, you should be able to identify and resolve the "no such table" error in your Django project.
